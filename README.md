# BEEST
<p>BEEST stands for Boostrap Enhanced Elements Streamlining Tool. The processes on the various pages take user input (text, links, media) and combine them with pre-written code elements to create content formats that look good, are responsive and user friendly. Use the menu at the top of screen to navigate to the element you wish to create.</p>
<h3>Important caveats</h3>
<p>These elements require <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/" target="_blank">Bootstrap v4.0</a> and up to function. The BEEST tool is purpose built for use with Moodle 3.7 and upwards to manipulate content to be responsive and inviting to the user. Should you require any assistance with the use of the BEEST tools or have a suggestion on an element you would like added to the suite we have on offer, please email the creators:</p>
