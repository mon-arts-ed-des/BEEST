## What is the BEEST?
BEEST stands for **B**ootstrap **E**nhanced **E**lements **S**treamlining **T**ool. BEEST takes your input and combines it with pre-written HTML to generate advanced HTML elements without the need for complex HTML skills.

## What can BEEST do that nothing else can?
Take a look at the videos on the right to see the BEEST in action. For the details, read on. This tool, **when used appropriately**, can create responsive, consistent, quality HTML elements that improve your Moodle site's user experience (UX) design while also meeting WCAG accessibility standards. As technology and the digital learning space continues to develop at a rapid pace, students are now not only expecting meaningful, applied, active learning approaches, they want the experience of interacting with the learning content to be an engaging, clear and easy to operate experience. This is why the BEEST was designed. So often, high-quality teachers and designers use up an incredible amount of time and effort manipulating HTML to make their learning sites a quality user experience as well. BEEST can cut the time needed and the skills required to achieve this by a vast amount. This means more time for planning learning content, and more teachers having access to high-level design features they thought were out of reach.

## Why use the BEEST?
If you are producing high quality teaching and learning in your Moodle site, and want to take it to the next level for your students, BEEST can help you reformat your existing content, and support a responsive, high-quality end-user learning product.

## How do I use the BEEST?
On each of the pages there are step by step instructions on what input you need to provide, and how to manipulate the respective element to produce the final result desired. Each page will also produce a preview. This is so you can take a sneak peek at what you have created before pasting it into Moodle and make and changes you feel are necessary.
